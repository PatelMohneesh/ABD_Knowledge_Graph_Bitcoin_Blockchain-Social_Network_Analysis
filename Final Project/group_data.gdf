5c205c40ec9b25efe967a889bb311ecf6b6996fb,https://youtu.be/yPzaW26_Hks Hi all  Columbia Blue Glaze Theatre is producing the play A Beautiful Country by Chay Yew this Thurs-Saturday. Come for a good show!   — A Beautiful Country by Chay Yew — For its spring production  Columbia Blue Glaze Theatre is proud to present A Beautiful Country  a play written by the Singaporean American playwright Chay Yew. Incorporating tragicomic scenes  video  dance  and first-person testimonials  the play chronicles the turbulent history of Asian America  drifting from the aching memories of Angel Island to the loss and melancholy experienced by the Asian diaspora in the present day. Through the eyes of Miss Visa Denied  a transgender performer who struggles to come to terms with their non-binary identity  Yew dramatizes America’s contradictory messages regarding race  gender  and orientalism. At its core  the play seeks to examine the fundamental questions regarding the immigrant experience—what does it mean to be an American  and what would it take to finally become one?  Show Dates: 4/27-29 at 8PM in Lerner Black Box Theatre  at Columbia University.  (Talkback discussions will be held after the performance on 4/27 and 4/28.)
